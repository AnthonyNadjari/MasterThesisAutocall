# Master Thesis - "Equity Structured products : Goals and Pricing of Autocallable Structures"

Master Thesis writtend during my internship at Cr√©dit Agricole CIB in Equity Derivatives Structuring. The thesis aims at presenting common products, bullets or autocallable, that banks are nowadays very inclined to trade.
Second, we get more into details and study differente ways of pricing autocallable products, as well as how to optimize and calibrate the parameters of these products to best meet the clients' needs and the bank's ressources and hedging strategies.
<br> The GitHub repository is divided into two files:
* **PDF Thesis**: written thesis explaining products and computations
* **Excel & VBA file**: contains the pricer of the Thesis. I developped Black-Scholes & Heston modeles to compute the prices of Athena and Phoenix autocalls. The file allows a comparison of the computation times, computation of the greeks, redemption probabilities and duration. A vanilla option pricer is also available.
